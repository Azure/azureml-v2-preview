Canary Flow with Gitops
======================

What is GitOps
--------------

`GitOps <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitops>`_ is code-based infrastructure and operational procedures that rely on Git as a source control system. Itâ€™s an evolution of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and a DevOps best practice that leverages Git as the **single source of truth, and control mechanism for creating, updating, and deleting system architecture**. More simply, it is the **practice of using Git pull requests to verify and automatically deploy system infrastructure modifications**.

Step 1: Deploy & test the v1 version of the model(blue) in AML Compute 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the :ref:`simple-deploy-flow` section to create an endpoint with  "blue" deployment

Step 2: Scale the blue deployment to handle additional traffic
--------------------------------------------------------------
.. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint update --file ../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/2-scale-blue.yaml


.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/2-scale-blue.yaml
   :language: yaml

Step 3: Deploy a new model (green) to the endpoint, but taking NO live traffic yet
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint update --file ../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/3-create-green.yaml


.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/3-create-green.yaml
   :language: yaml

**Test the new deployment by directly invoking it** (since invoking the endpoint would only use the blue deployment for now)

.. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint invoke --name my-endpoint --deployment green --request-file ../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/sample-request.json

Step 4: Test the green deployment with a small percentage of the live traffic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint update --file ../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/4-flight-green.yaml

This is the yaml file

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/4-flight-green.yaml
   :language: yaml

Step 5: Let the green deployment take on the full traffic
---------------------------------------------------------
 
 .. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint update --file ../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/5-full-green.yaml

This is the yaml file

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/5-full-green.yaml
   :language: yaml

Step 6: Now since green is working fine, lets delete the blue deployment
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 .. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint update --file ../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/6-delete-blue.yaml

This is the yaml file

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/endpoints/online/managed/canary-gitops-flow/6-delete-blue.yaml
   :language: yaml

Step 7: Cleanup - delete the endpoint
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    az ml endpoint delete --name my-endpoint

This deletes the endpoint along with any active deployments
